## General Information
BoomBikes is a US bike-sharing provider, Bike-sharing service system is a service in which bike 
is made available for shared use, Due to Corona pandemic there are dips in their revenues. They 
want to analyse and predict the demand. Based on the prediction they want to build their business plan 
to accelerate the revue and sustainability. Bike rental prediction depends on multiple factors. This 
project focuses on building a Multiple Linear Regression (MLR) machine learning model to predict the demand based 
on different factors.


## Conclusions
**Insight from EDA and Data visualisation:** 
- Year: Increase in bike sharing business in year 2019 in comparison of year 2018 (Boxplot)
- Holiday: There is a decrease in the bike sharing business in Holidays (Boxplot)
- Temperature: Bike sharing business is impacted from the temperature feature
- Season: Both Winter and Summer Season having positive impact on bike sharing business,
- Month: August, September having higher median compared to other months.
- From the box plot above other variables correlation can be derived.

**Feature variables:**
-	year
-	holiday
-	workingDay
-	temp
-	humidity
-	windSpeed
-	Monday
-	Sunday
-	Spring
-	Summer
-	Winter
-	July
-	September
-	Mist
-	PartlyCloudy

BoomBikes should consider above features for predicting the business.
